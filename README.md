# C

1. C programming is a *general-purpose*, *procedural*, imperative computer programming language.
2. C was initially used for *system development work*, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system.
3. C was adopted as a **system development language** because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in *assembly language*.


### Features of C

1. C is a robust language with a rich set of built-in functions and operators.
2. Programs written in C are *efficient and fast*.
3. C is **highly portable**; programs once written in C can be run on other machines with minor or no modification.
4. C is a collection of C library functions; we can also create our function and add it to the C library.
5. C is easily extensible.

### Advantages of C

1. C is the building block for many other programming languages.
2. Programs written in C are highly portable.
3. Several standard functions are there (like in-built) that can be used to develop programs.
4. C programs are collections of C library functions, and it's also easy to add functions to the C library.
5. The modular structure makes code debugging, maintenance, and testing easier.

### Limitations of C

1. C compilers can only *identify errors* and are **incapable of handling exceptions** (run-time errors).
2. C provides **no data protection**.
3. C does not provide Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
